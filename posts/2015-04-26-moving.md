Kasumi will move out of her place on 16/17th May, I'll move out of my apartment on 22nd May and fly back to Kansai for Takky's wedding on 23rd May.

A busy few weeks.

Still need to find a job in Osaka or Kobe.
I'm thinking of looking for some creative work, but I'm not sure my portfolio is good enough. Need to make some interesting stuff or improve my Github account content.


Things to do for this site:

  - add social media buttons for twitter, facebook, github and lastfm.
  - edit the layout design
