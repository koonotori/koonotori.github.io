Renewed a little bit.

Got colour inspiration from [Ben Woodward](http://benw.me)'s Rails blog, and a little help with border shading from [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18212020) on StackOverflow.

Still a few things to iron out, but minimal is okay for now.

Should make a balls out web dev portfolio type thing soon, though.
