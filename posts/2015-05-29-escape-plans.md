Spoke with a co-worker today about posible options for the job situation.  
He suggested I speak to the boss about the possibility of working remotely from Kansai up to the point where either current staff can take over my work, or until someone comes into replace me and they can help to train them.

We came up with the following plans.

He also suggested outlining the time and money that would be saved, and ultimately to explain my situation to them as objectively as possible, that it's currently a negative situation that won't improve the longer it continues.

I need to convince him that moving back to Kansai ahead of time could have a positive effect, otherwise he won't allow it.

### Plan A

Find someone to replace me. Train them. Leave cleanly.

  - Clean break (+)
  - I'm free (+)
  - Company continues (+)

### Plan B

While finding someone, leave for Kansai and work remotely. Teach current staff so they can take over. Until then.

  - Not so clean (-)
  - I'm temporarily tied to the job (-)
  - Will be able to move to Kansai (+)
  - Eventually free (+)


### Plan C

Continue the same job remotely from Kansai.

  - Not clean (-)
  - Not free from job (-)
  - Live in Kansai (+)
